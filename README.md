# prntScavenger
Website that let's you find random prnt.sc screenshots.

# What?
Prnt.sc is a site that lets you upload screenshots so you can share them with a short link. The link is so short and there is so many screenshots that it's easy to put six random numbers and letters and find someones screenshot. So this became a trend and I decided to make a site that let's you do this faster.

# Tech info
You might be thinking a simple ajax request could do the trick but that is blocked by CORS. So I had to do the scraping with PHP.
